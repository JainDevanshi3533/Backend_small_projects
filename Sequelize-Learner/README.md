ORM: Object Relational Mapping

-> orms are libraries that are used to do all the heavy lifting in the background for us...so that we dont focus on database queries and can now focus more on nodejs code.

->orms convert database queries into easy to use javascript objects.

-> for eg: Sequelize is an orm for sql based databases.
